# Python NumPy Exercises
## . Exercise_1 - Creating a User Interactive Numpy Array
The purpose of this project, creating is to one-dimensional array or two-dimensional array with user interaction.<br/>
For code [explain.](https://github.com/yasinbrcn/PythonNumPyExercises/blob/main/Exercise_01%20-%20Creating%20a%20User%20Interactive%20Numpy%20Array/create_numpy_array.ipynb)
## . Exercise_2 - Methods of Creating Numpy Array
In this exercise, I have specified methods that can be used to create arrays with the python numpy library.<br/>
I mention seven functions you can use to create a numpy array in this exercise. These functions are shown below.<br/>
**- np.zeros()**<br/>
**- np.ones()**<br/>
**- np.full()**<br/>
**- np.arange()**<br/>
**- np.linspace()**<br/>
**- np.random.normal()**<br/>
**- np.random.randint()**<br/>
You can find explanations and examples of functions in this exercise.
## . Exercise_3 - Search Engine
The purpose of this exercise is to find integer values received from the user in a randomly generated numpy array.<br/>
The program gives the following output:<br/>
- The numpy list as generated randomly.(It is set to create an array with a maximum of 100 rows, 100 columns and 100 elements.)
- Cell numbers of searched integer value.
- Row and column numbers of randomly generated array.
- How many times the searched integer value repeated in the array.
